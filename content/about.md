# About

This project is led by Dr. Joshua Rosenberg, Dr. Lynn Hodge, and Dr. Mehmet Aydeniz, all at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

An abstract for the project is here:

> This project aims to assemble a team to support K-8 computer science education efforts in East Tennessee. In particular, this project is responsive to the introduction of new computer science standards (Tennessee Department of Education, 2018) for grades K-8 for the 2019-2020 school year. The aims of this project are to better understand administrator and teacher needs related to computer science education. To achieve this goal, a research-practice partnership with a rural, area district will be developed. Through this partnership, we will carry out a needs assessment and teacher professional development sessionsbased upon the needs expressed by administrators and teachers and assets that already exist in the community. This project has the potential to impact computer science education throughout East Tennessee and the state of Tennessee by scaling up the work through support from small- and medium-sized CSforALL:RPP National Science Foundation sources of funding.
