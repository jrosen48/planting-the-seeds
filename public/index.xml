      <description>Beginning today, we are starting a project supported by the University of Tennessee, Knoxville Community Engaged Research Seed Program.
An abstract for the project is here:
 This project aims to assemble a team to support K-8 computer science education efforts in East Tennessee. In particular, this project is responsive to the introduction of new computer science standards (Tennessee Department of Education, 2018) for grades K-8 for the 2019-2020 school year.</description>
